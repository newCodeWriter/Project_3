# Todo List
Marshay Brown

# Overview/Description

The project is a React-based todo list web app that utilizes Redux for state management and React Router for navigation with a contact form that uses controlled components.

# Functionality

The user can navigate to the Todos view and add a number of items to a task list that will be managed by and stored in the Redux store. There is an input field and a "Add" button that allows the user to add a new item to the list. When the item is marked as complete, there is a strike-through effect in addition to a checkmark. The user also has the option to delete the item from the list by clicking on the item's trash icon. The Todos view also offers the user the option to view either all todos, completed todos or incomplete todos. When the user navigates to the Contact view, the user will be presented with a view that displays a form with the following fields: first name, last name, e-mail, and comments. This form functions as a controlled component. When the user submits the form, the information entered is logged in the console.  

# Technologies Used

.html,.js, react, react-redux, react router

# User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to build and add onto a task list so I can keep track of all my tasks (new and outstanding). 
As a user, I want to be able to filter all my todos so that I will be able to view which tasks are complete and which are not. 
As a user, I want to be able to delete items (whether complete or incomplete) from a task list so that I have the option to remove items or edit the task list.

# Ideas for improvement

The user can edit a task without having to delete the item and re-enter the task. The user can search tasks using keywords. The user can prioritize and order (and re-order) items in the task list.
